## Skill List

1. I can compare/order asymptotic running times.

2. I can find a concise big-O bound for a given function.

3. I can analyze the running time of simple algorithms in the word-RAM model.

4. I can solve recurrences.

5. I can choose the most efficient data structure for a given problem/scenario.

6. I can extend (i.e., implement a new operation for) a data structure I have seen before.

7. I can illustrate the operation of insertion sort, mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort.

8. I can illustrate the operation of fundamental graph algorithms (like BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford).

9. I can determine the running time of a graph algorithm using either of the two standard graph representations.


10. I can find a counterexample for a flawed greedy algorithm.
